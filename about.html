            <p class="intro-text">Hello I'm  Dammy Olude a 2nd year tech management student with a passion for technology that grows stronger with each passing day.<br> My journey into the world of tech began with a curiosity to understand how things work, and it has evolved into a deep-seated love for innovation and problem-solving.
        
                Outside of my academic pursuits, I have a diverse set of interests.<br> I used to learn how to play the guitar, finding joy in the melodies and rhythms that music can create.<br> My love for physical activity led me to the badminton court, where I enjoy the fast-paced and competitive nature of the sport.<br>
                
                 Intriguingly, I also have a background in competitive archery, a discipline that requires precision, focus, and dedication. This experience has taught me valuable life skills that I apply to my academic and professional endeavors.<br>
                
                I'm excited about the ever-evolving tech landscape and look forward to exploring opportunities that allow me to combine my management skills with my tech-savvy mindset. Whether it's tackling complex tech challenges or strumming a guitar chord, I'm driven by the desire to continuously learn and grow..</p>
